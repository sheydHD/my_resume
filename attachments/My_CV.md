## WORK HISTORY

### HIWI, 07/2025 - Current

**RWTH Aachen, Lehr- Und Forschungsgebiet Kontinuumsmechanik** - Aachen, Germany

- Adjusted **Deep Symbolic Optimization (DSO)** code (2022) to modern standards using **Python 3.11** and **TensorFlow 2.x**.
- Increased code functionality extending the framework from **MISO (Multiple Input Single Output)** to **MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)**.
- Documented codebase and adapted software for compatibility across diverse operating systems.

### Working Student, 11/2024 - Current

**Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR)** - Köln, Germany

- Designed and deployed **DLR-AutoMat**, a full-stack web app (Python/FastAPI backend, React frontend) for automated generation of material cards for LS-Dyna simulations.
- Integrated a **MongoDB-based metadata search engine** to enable fast and efficient retrieval of experimental and simulation data.
- Deployed **Chemotion ELN** with PostgreSQL on company servers and ensured seamless interoperability with DLR-AutoMat and MongoDB.
- Connected all systems to the company's **cloud infrastructure**, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability through Docker and Git-based DevOps workflows.

### Bachelor Thesis, 06/2024 - 09/2024

**Mercedes-Benz Group AG** - Sindelfingen, Germany

- Bachelor thesis topic: "Evaluation of ML-based models for the detection of corrosion-prone areas during the vehicle development process"
- **Created and structured datasets** to train and **evaluate ML models** for identifying corrosion-prone areas during a vehicle design.
- Conducted interviews with field experts and further evaluated in-depth performance with applied statistical metric like **MCC**.
- Improved segmentation quality by identifying model weaknesses and refining feature engineering methods in **MATLAB**.

### Internship, 10/2023 - 04/2024

**Mercedes-Benz Group AG** - Sindelfingen, Germany

- Contributed to development of ML-based models for the detection of corrosion-prone areas during vehicle development
